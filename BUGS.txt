BUGS

1) In MapsActivity.java, it is supposed to call the SwitchArrivalPage after the location is picked and data is send, but I don't know where to put the SwitchArrivalPage and there's something wrong with the data sending. So I just put SwitchArrivalPage at the very beginning and the location picker is not called in this way.

2) In ArrivalPage.java, it is supposed to first send arrival info to web and then call the SwitchFinalPage, but there is something wrong with the data sending as well.


* The entire project, though not perfect, can at least run in this way.
* I have all the code in the project, but I just commented them off.
