BUGS

1)  **Fixed** In MapsActivity.java, it is supposed to call the SwitchArrivalPage after the location is picked and data is send, but I don't know where to put the SwitchArrivalPage and there's something wrong with the data sending. So I just put SwitchArrivalPage at the very beginning and the location picker is not called in this way.

2) *(Fixable dependig on server InTransit working)* In ArrivalPage.java, it is supposed to first send arrival info to web and then call the SwitchFinalPage, but there is something wrong with the data sending as well.


* The entire project, though not perfect, can at least run in this way.
* I have all the code in the project, but I just commented them off.
